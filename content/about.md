I am a Post Secondary graduate from MITT with a diploma in Cyber Defense and Cloud Administration. Pembina Trails Early College (PTEC) 2022 Alumni. PTEC was an integrated program that blended together high school and post-secondary technology curriculum, certification, and work experience. My dream job would be becoming a penetration tester or working with a Red/Blue Team. I have always been interested in and proficient with technology, as well as a highly analytical thinker when it comes to technology or just everyday life. I have a motivation to continually expand my knowledge within the vast field that is technology, cyber security, networking, and ethical hacking!

I am starting to study Security+ as my next certification. I learned a lot of content through my diploma but didn't take the exams, so now I am refreshing what I know and catching up on certs such as Security+, Pentest+, M365 Fundamentals, AZ-900, AWS Cloud Architect, CCNA, and CCNP Routing and Switching.
