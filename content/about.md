I am a Post Secondary graduate from MITT with a Program Excellence in Cyber Defense and Cloud Administration. Pembina Trails Early College (PTEC) 2022 Alumni and Valedictorian. PTEC is an integrated program that blended together high school and post-secondary technology curriculum, certification, and work experience. My dream job would be becoming a penetration tester or working with a Red/Blue Team. 

I like to apply my skills through Cyber Defence and System Admin competitions, Capture the Flag events, and maintaining my own home lab environment. I am a highly analytical thinker when it comes to any challenge or just everyday life!

### Current Job Role:
- I configure, stage, and deploy new POS systems to our clients. Providing a Tier 2-3 type of support for these systems, given their critical operation and high pressure environments. I document progress, communicate between the team and clients, manage timelines for system installs, and more. This includes troubleshooting LAN/WAN issues, iOS devices, payment processing, etc.

- Currently leading a large-scale project to integrate our software in a previously untapped market, which has required me to understand and converse in complicated governmental regulations, standards and requirements. Currently have responsibilities akin to Infrastructure/Solutions Engineers, Software Devs, and DevOps. Worked with EDRs, SIEMs and security frameworks to provide system and application security. Communicating with government organizations, while working within the midst of many other major Canadian restaurant/quick-service corporations.

- Building infrastructure and connecting AWS products such as API gateways, SQS queue, DynamoDB, Lambdas, Secrets Manager, IAM with custom roles, and CloudWatch. Maintaining cost efficient operation of said products. Implementing best practices such as scalability, high availability, and emergency response plans.

- When my schedule allows, I provide support to Google and Microsoft office environments for certain clients, build iOS/Android Apps as needed, and build internal tools or web-apps. Currently in the process of creating a Knowledge Base from the ground up for our support team. When there's a question to be answered or something that needs to be done, I make it happen!

My next goals are to refresh what I know for certs such as Security+, Pentest+, M365 Fundamentals, AWS Cloud Architect, CCNA, and CCNP Routing and Switching. Many topics I studied in school, but didn't make the time to actually get certified.
